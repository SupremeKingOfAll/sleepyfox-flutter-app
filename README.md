# SleepyFox 🦊

**SleepyFox** is a mobile app built using Flutter that helps parents track their child's sleep habits. This application was developed as part of a university-industry project
for a real client (SleepyFox). The project involved working to client requirements and delivering a functional mobile solution using Flutter.

state management using Provider, and data visualisation features.
