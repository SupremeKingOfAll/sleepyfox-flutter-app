# SleepyFox 🦊

**SleepyFox** is a mobile application designed to help parents track and understand their child’s sleep habits.  
The application was developed as part of a university–industry project for a real external client, working to defined client requirements and delivering a functional mobile solution.

The project focused on building a maintainable, user-friendly system that supports consistent sleep tracking and simple data visualisation.
